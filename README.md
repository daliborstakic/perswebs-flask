# Personal website with Flask

## What I've done
Personally, I'm quite proud of this simple website that I've made. In my opinion it has a clean design and it perfectly represents me.
The site has a header, an about and a contact section, which are currently filled with placeholder text. Also there's a GitHub section which is pretty bland right now.
Also, there is a footer, because every site needs one.

## What I hope to implement
I would like to implement some sort of Web Scraping using the GitHub ApiV3 so I could present my statistics in realtime. All in times due.
